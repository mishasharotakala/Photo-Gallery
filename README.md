# Photo Gallery

This project is a simple photo gallery implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to view a collection of photos and filter them based on their color properties.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The photo gallery is designed to be responsive and works well on all screen sizes.
- **Photo Filtering:** You can filter the photos based on their color properties. There are two filters available: "Colored Photos" and "Unshaded Photos".
- **Photo Popup:** When you click on a photo, it opens in a popup for a larger view. You can close the popup by clicking anywhere outside the photo.

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Use the radio buttons at the top of the page to filter the photos.
3. Click on a photo to view it in a larger size. Click anywhere outside the photo to close the popup.

## Code Overview

- **HTML:** The HTML structure of the page consists of a container for the photos and radio buttons for the filters. Each photo is wrapped in a `<div>` with a class of `pic` and has an additional class indicating its color property (colored or unshaded).
  
- **CSS:** Styles the page and provides the responsive design. It also includes animations and transitions for a better user experience.

- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity to the page. It handles the filtering of photos based on the selected radio button and the opening and closing of the photo popup.

## Future Improvements

- Add more filters for different photo properties.
- Implement a search functionality to find photos by their names or descriptions.
- Improve the popup functionality to include navigation buttons for viewing the next and previous photos.
